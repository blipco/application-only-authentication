# Application-only Authentication

Authentication for API's can be tricky. For this magic afternoon, we're going to practice connecting to Twitter's API and issuing authenticate requests on behalf of an application (Application-only authentication).

Some resources:
 - [Create a Twitter App](https://apps.twitter.com/)
 - [Authentication Tutorial](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-only)

### Level 1
Create a new application on Twitter, using their [application management portal](https://apps.twitter.com/).
Add your consumer key and secret to the server.

### Level 2:
Encode your consumer key and secret and retrieve an access token from Twitter's API.

### Level 3:
On the front-end, make a request to your server with the user's search term and retrieve a list of tweets!

### Level 4:
Nicely design and display the tweets to the user.

### Level 5:
Remove your consumer key and secret and add them as environment variables.
Push your project up to heroku!

### Conclusion
The specification is otherwise open-ended to the implementation of the page set-up.
